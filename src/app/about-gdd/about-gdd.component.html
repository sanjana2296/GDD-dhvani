      <mat-card >The term 'developmental delay' or 'global development delay' is used when a child takes longer to reach certain development milestones than other children their age.
   
       This might include learning to walk or talk, movement skills, learning new things and interacting with others socially and emotionally.
       
       Someone with another condition, like Down’s syndrome or Cerebral palsy, may also have Global developmental delay.</mat-card>

        <mat-card> Doctors sometimes use the terms “developmental delay” and “developmental disability” to mean the same thing. They’re actually not the same thing, but it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a young child has a delay or a disability, or why.
   
         Developmental disabilities are issues that kids don’t outgrow or catch up from, though they can make progress. They aren’t the same as learning disabilities, but they can make learning more difficult. Some conditions that can cause developmental disabilities include Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, autism, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and brain injuries.
