<p>We must understand and accept that children develop at their own
pace, so don't be alarmed if your child takes a slightly different
course. Every parent, however, has the right to find out if there is
something different.<br/>
The first five years of children’s life is most important as it during
this period when they develop most of the abilities. All children need
to be encouraged when they achieve these skills by us, their parents.
<br/>
We need to give them love and affection, sing, talk, listen and play
with them<br/>
Developmental Delay provides an opportunity for provision of services
and programs based on a child’s strengths and needs, as measured by
the five developmental areas, when the assessment of a more specific
disability due to a child’s young age cannot be considered statistically
reliable or valid.<br/><br/>
The five developmental domains assessed for Developmental Delay
are:<br/>
1. Physical/Motor coordination: Gross/fine motor skills, jumping,
hopping, throwing/catching, drawing, stacking<br/>
2. Cognitive: Thinking, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding<br/>
3. Communication: Smiling, listening, babbling, talking, pointing to
things<br/>
4. Social/Emotional: Initiating peer contact, group play, showing
affection, copying facial expressions<br/>
5. Adaptive: Dressing, eating, washing<br/><br/>

Now when a child has delayed development in two or more of the
above domains, then the child may have “global developmental
delay” or GDD.<br/>
A child may just have delay in one specific domain this is not GDD and
may have a different diagnostic and treatment approach. So, it is
important that the type of delay is identified as early as possible so
support for your child can begin and it usually is tailored to your
child’s specific needs. The earlier support is put in place, the better
chance of improvement for the child.<br/><br/>
<span style="background: yellow; font-size:130%">Is your child showing signs of developmental delay?</span><br/>


More often than not, parents are often the first to realize that their
child is not developing in an expected way or at the same pace as
their peers.<br/>
A child’s development can be slower than others for various reasons,
including if they are born prematurely or become ill. If a child
becomes severely ill they may even appear to regress and no longer be
able to do things they could before the onset of the illness. For most

children, once they recover, their development will speed up and they
will catch up.<br/>
Family events such as the arrival of a new baby in a family can also
cause a child to slow down their progress for a short while. If a
child’s progress slows for a while, and there seems to be a reason for
this, such as one of the events above, this is not necessarily a cause
for concern. But if the delay is persistent, or happens for no obvious
reason, it is important that you seek advice so that any help can be
given as soon as possible.<br/>
Any accident or illness that affects the brain can also impact on a
child’s development. Some children will be slower in their progress
because they are born with a medical condition which restricts their
development. This condition might be diagnosed shortly after their
birth. However, a child being slow in their development can sometimes
be the first sign that the child has an underlying medical condition.<br/><br/>
Important: If you are worried about your child’s progress you
should talk to your pediatrician. It is time to make a visit<br/>
<br/><span style="color:rgb(196, 114, 127)"><i>
“When I noticed Ishaani wasn’t progressing the way she should, the
doctor I took her to, didn’t know much about her medical condition,
she had never such a case but she did refer us to another doctor
from a bigger hospital” &lt;all pink content should be like a talk icon&gt;</i></span>
<br/><br/>
<span style="background: yellow; font-size:130%">Remember: It will take time for the doctors to make the diagnosis</span><br/>
Specialists will consider all the different areas of concern for your
child and think about the most likely reasons for their difficulties.
They might carry out tests to rule out possible causes or to confirm
what the reasons are. They may even find a name or ‘diagnosis’ for
the condition. However, different conditions can cause similar
symptoms and it is not always possible to test for all of these.<br/>
It might be necessary to wait to see if your child makes progress in
their development, or for other symptoms to appear that will help in
making a diagnosis.<br/>
If a child has a rare condition it can be even more difficult for
doctors to identify the reasons, as less is known about the condition
and the doctor might never have seen someone with that condition
before.<br/>

Advances in science and genetic testing means new conditions are
being identified all the time. It is not possible for doctors to know
about all of these conditions, but this should not prevent them from
being able to treat your child’s symptoms.<br/>
Children can sometimes wait for years for a diagnosis and some never
get a diagnosis, but support is still available for them even without a
diagnosis. Some parents can find this a worrying time. Not having a
diagnosis for a child’s condition can seem worse than knowing and
parents are often bewildered by what could be the cause.<br/>
Not all parents, however, will react in this way. Sometimes parents
prefer not to have a diagnosis as this helps them focus on the issues
that are happening rather than compare their child with others with
the same condition. Even if your child has been diagnosed with a
condition, it can still be difficult to know how this will affect them as
the same condition can affect children in different ways.<br/><br/><br/>
<span style="color:rgb(196, 114, 127)"><i>
In Ishaani’s case, the first few years was a struggle for me, I did not
know anyone who had a child like her or what her condition was called.
I constantly was under pressure to finding a name for our daughter’s
condition and kept researching on this wherever and whenever I
could. My daughter’s pediatrician listened to everything I said, but
was helpless as she explained that Ishaani had overlapping symptoms
and no single name could be given to her condition. Till the end
Ishaani was undiagnosed and there was no specific name for her
condition”</i></span>

        <mat-card> Doctors sometimes use the terms “developmental delay” and “developmental disability” to mean the same thing. They’re actually not the same thing, but it is sometimes difficult to determine whether a young child has a delay or a disability, or why.
   
         Developmental disabilities are issues that kids don’t outgrow or catch up from, though they can make progress. They aren’t the same as learning disabilities, but they can make learning more difficult. Some conditions that can cause developmental disabilities include Down syndrome, Angelman syndrome, autism, fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASD) and brain injuries.
