            If you’ve reached here, I’m thinking it’s either because you have googled “GDD”
or “Global Development Delay” or “developmental delay”. Are you doing the right
thing looking for help? Yes, <x id="START_BOLD_TEXT" ctype="x-b" equiv-text="&lt;b&gt;"/><x id="START_ITALIC_TEXT" ctype="x-i" equiv-text="&lt;i&gt;"/>you are<x id="CLOSE_ITALIC_TEXT" ctype="x-i" equiv-text="&lt;/i&gt;"/><x id="CLOSE_BOLD_TEXT" ctype="x-b" equiv-text="&lt;/b&gt;"/> doing the right thing! You want to learn more
of what may seem different in your child as compared to children in his/her age
group, so that I feel “is a step in the right direction!.” 
            <x id="LINE_BREAK" ctype="lb" equiv-text="&lt;br/&gt;"/>This website “dhvani.life” is a forum, for connecting parents of children with GDD.
            I designed this website as a support system for parents especially mothers of such
            innocent angels. I consider <x id="START_BOLD_TEXT" ctype="x-b" equiv-text="&lt;b&gt;"/><x id="START_ITALIC_TEXT" ctype="x-i" equiv-text="&lt;i&gt;"/>“support”<x id="CLOSE_ITALIC_TEXT" ctype="x-i" equiv-text="&lt;/i&gt;"/><x id="CLOSE_BOLD_TEXT" ctype="x-b" equiv-text="&lt;/b&gt;"/> a necessity and I believe a strong and “aware”
            mother will help the entire family (which may include other normal siblings and
            the father) to carry on as a normal family. Every mother hopes that her child is
            growing according to the milestones of a normal child. But what do you do if you
            notice a delay?
            
              <x id="START_TAG_SPAN_3" ctype="x-span" equiv-text="&lt;span&gt;"/><x id="LINE_BREAK" ctype="lb" equiv-text="&lt;br/&gt;"/>Being a mother of a child with a generic name for her condition called “degenerative neuroregression” I can completely empathize with this constant need to become aware, to know more and to find a way to help our bundle of joy.
                <x id="LINE_BREAK" ctype="lb" equiv-text="&lt;br/&gt;"/>We (my team and I) have tried to include resources that will benefit you and your
                loved ones. In India especially, there is a lack of <x id="START_TAG_SPAN_2" ctype="x-span" equiv-text="&lt;span&gt;"/>awareness of rare conditions such
                as the one my daughter, Ishaani had been categorized under.<x id="CLOSE_TAG_SPAN" ctype="x-span" equiv-text="&lt;/span&gt;"/> I wish that the other mothers unlike
                me do not have to struggle as much as I did with no information or direction on
                how to manage such a child. My daughter is no more with us, she passed away on
                June 4th, 2019 at 10 years and 2 months. She was a “fighter” and fought her way
                during the years she was with us. She brought serenity, joy and love to all those
                who had the chance to be with her. She is my inspiration and my strength along
                with my son, her elder brother.

                that there are others just like you. You are not alone. Most of the content that you

    I believe in the motto “The purpose of life is a life with a purpose”.
    When I started this project, my only thought was how could I, an
    ordinary working mother of a child with an undiagnosed condition,
    make a difference. My family and I worked hard to give Ishaani the
    quality of life that she deserved. I am lucky to have had the support
    of my family members in doing that. We were lucky to be working
    parents who could bear the burden of bringing up, taking care of such
    a child but there may be parents out there who may be facing
    financial problems or find it difficult to pay their medical/hospital
    bills.<x id="LINE_BREAK" ctype="lb" equiv-text="&lt;br/&gt;"/>
    At dhvani.life we felt that we could help reach out to such parents
    and families. We want to create an awareness of GDD and for this we
    seek your help. You can choose to donate for either:<x id="LINE_BREAK" ctype="lb" equiv-text="&lt;br/&gt;"/>

    We intend to organize awareness camps across the state of
    Karnataka, reaching the remote locations as well. To do this, we need
    your assistance in the form of donations. All payments will go to
    “dhavni.life fund” and we will provide you the transaction sheets for
    all the amounts that we receive. As mentioned in our bench marks, we
    believe in not making a profit out of this. The idea is to connect such
    families to health care outlets where the child can avail medical
    facilities.
