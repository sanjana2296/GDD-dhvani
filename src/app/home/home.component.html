            Namaste!<br/>
            
            If you’ve reached here, I’m thinking it’s either because you have googled “GDD” or “Global Development Delay.” Are you doing the right thing looking for help. Yes, you are doing the right thing to learn more of what may seem different in your child as compared to his/her age group.
            
            <br/>This website “dhvani.life” is an application for connecting parents of children with GDD. I designed this website as a support system for parents especially mothers of such innocent angels. I consider “support” a necessity and I believe a strong and “aware” mother will help the family (which may include other normal siblings and the father) to carry on as a normal family. Every mother hopes that her child is growing according to milestones of a normal child. But what do you do if you notice a delay?
            
              <span class="read-more-target"><br/>Being a mother of a child with a generic name for her condition called “degenerative neuroregression” I can completely empathize with this constant need to become aware, to know more and to find a way to help our bundle of joy.
                <br/>We (my team and I) have tried to include resources that will benefit you and your loved ones. In India especially, there is a lack of awareness of rare conditions such as the one my daughter suffered from, I wish that mothers like me do not have to struggle as I did with no direction on how to manage my child.
