    When my daughter Ishaani was born, it was our happiest day, she was
    a bubbly baby. It was a normal delivery and she had cried at birth.
    Who was to know that by the time she attained one year, things were
    going to change. Here is a chart for a normal childâ€™s growth milestone.
    Thank you Dr. Fatima for the chart!</p>
